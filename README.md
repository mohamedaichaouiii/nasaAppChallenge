# README for NASA App Challenge - Orrery Web App

## Project Overview
This project is an interactive web application designed for the NASA App Challenge. The application provides a rich interface for exploring near-Earth objects (NEOs), potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs), and Apollo-class asteroids. It offers a comprehensive guide to various asteroid missions, including real-time data on asteroids, their orbits, and their impact risks on Earth.

The key sections of the application include:
- **Home Page:** Provides an introduction to near-Earth objects and offers a call to action for users to start navigating the app.
- **Flight List:** Displays detailed information about specific asteroids, including orbital details.
- **Mission History:** Explores key space missions related to asteroid impact prevention, like the DART mission.
- **Experience Section:** Presents a list of notable asteroids, including size, orbit, and potential hazard information.
- **Keplerian Orbit Calculator:** Allows users to input orbital parameters (eccentricity, semi-major axis, inclination, etc.) to visualize asteroid orbits.

## Features
1. **Asteroid Information:** 
   - Provides detailed information about specific near-Earth objects and asteroids, including 2019 OK, 99942 Apophis, and others.
   
2. **Keplerian Orbit Plotting:**
   - Users can enter parameters such as eccentricity, semi-major axis, and inclination to calculate and visualize asteroid orbits.
   
3. **Mission Information:**
   - Detailed sections on important asteroid deflection missions, such as the DART mission targeting Dimorphos, with relevant images and data.

4. **Real-Time Asteroid Data:**
   - Information on various Apollo-class asteroids and potentially hazardous asteroids (PHA) based on NASA’s data.

5. **Interactive User Interface:**
   - Utilizes animations, rotating planets, and a responsive design for better user engagement.

## How to Use
1. **Homepage:** Start by navigating through the Home section to get an overview of the app and what it offers.
2. **Flight List:** Browse through the list of asteroids, which contains crucial orbital information and hazard classifications.
3. **Mission History:** Explore the various space missions aimed at studying and potentially deflecting asteroids.
4. **Keplerian Orbit Calculator:** Input orbital parameters and plot the orbit of an asteroid in real time.
5. **Distance Display:** The app dynamically updates with visual representations of distances between Earth and various asteroids.

## File Structure
- **index.html:** The main HTML file for the web app.
- **style.css:** Contains the styles for the application, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.
- **keplerian.js:** Handles the orbit plotting logic based on user input of orbital parameters.
- **script.js:** Manages general interactive behavior, navigation, and other app functionalities.
- **img/**: This folder contains all images used in the app (planets, asteroids, etc.).
  
## Technologies Used
- **HTML5 and CSS3:** For structuring and styling the web application.
- **JavaScript:** For implementing the interactive features and calculating orbital paths.
- **Boxicons:** For embedding icons in the app.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the app is usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Instructions to Run
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. To modify or develop further, ensure to link your changes in `style.css` or the corresponding JavaScript files.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a real-time asteroid tracking system using NASA’s public API.
- Expand the Keplerian orbit calculator to include more orbital elements and enhance visualization.
- Include more interactive asteroid missions for users to explore.
